I love the idea of giving everyone access to powerful machines at minimal cost. The cloud makes this a reality. I’m working to publish a tool for the college which implements industry standard workflow scheduling algorithms working with one of my professors.

Any cloud position focusing on backend development would greatly increase my understanding and show me the full capabilities of the cloud. Beyond that, a specific interest of mine is peer-to-peer networks which remove the central server from the equation, increasing accessibility.
