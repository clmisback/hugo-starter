This is a website about **me**, my **accomplishments**, and my **aspirations**.

### Introduction

I was a transfer student originally attending **RIT** but finished out my postsecondary education at **Allegheny College**. I was born in Florida but raised near Pittsburgh where I graduated from Pine-Richland High School in 2017.

I aspire to be a **Software Engineer** focusing on the cloud and to help bring this technology to those less fortunate.
